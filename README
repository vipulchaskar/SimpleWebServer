Small HTTP server created to test against nmap scans. Requires root privileges to bind socket to port 80.
The purpose of creating this was to see if spoofed HTTP headers gets matched with nmap signatures of other popular HTTP servers. Hence in turn, getting a disguised http service name in nmap scan results.

WWW root directory: /usr/local/www

usage: user@localhost:/home/user#sudo ./webserver_v03

The server binds itself on port 80 (HTTP) and listens for incoming connections. On getting a valid HTTP request, it sends back the corresponding HTML page or else the notfound.htm page is sent.
